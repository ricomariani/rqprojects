                                    <h1 id="TOP">Microsoft Developer Services Agreement</h1><div class="BostonPostCard"><p>Updated October, 2013</p><p>This agreement is between you or the entity you represent and the Microsoft entity listed in Exhibit A, and consists of the terms below, Exhibit A, Exhibit B, the SLAs, Offer Details for any Service as published on the date of a Service purchase or renewal, terms incorporated by reference, terms applicable to other Microsoft web sites and services that you use and are necessary to use the Services (for example, your Microsoft Account) and, the Privacy Statement (together, the “Agreement”). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, such as your employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity. If you specify a company name in connection with signing up for or ordering a Service, you will be deemed to have placed that order and to have entered into this Agreement on behalf of that organization or company. Key terms are defined in Section 11. In addition, if you are a Windows Azure customer, this Agreement supplements your existing Windows Azure agreement and governs to the extent of any conflict with the Windows Azure terms (except that the Windows Azure billing terms will continue to apply).</p><h2>1. Services.</h2><div style="margin-left:20px"><ol type="a"><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Right to use.</strong> We grant you the right to access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>User Plan.</strong> Each user of the Visual Studio Online portion of the Developer Services must be allocated an individual User Plan, whether they access the service directly or indirectly.</li><li style="padding-bottom:4px"><strong>Manner of use.</strong> You may not:</li><ol type="i"><li>reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or work around technical limitations in the Services, except to the extent that applicable law permits it despite these limitations;</li><li>disable, tamper with or otherwise attempt to circumvent any mechanism that limits your use of the Services;</li><li>rent, lease, lend, resell, transfer, or sublicense any Services or portion thereof to or for third parties, except as explicitly permitted herein or in license terms that accompany any Services component;</li><li>use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by this Agreement; or</li><li>use the Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair any Microsoft service, or the network(s) connected to any Microsoft service, or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of any Services.</li></ol><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Updates.</strong> We may make changes to the Services from time to time, including: the availability of features; how long, how much or how often any given feature may be used; and feature dependencies upon other services or software. We will provide you with prior notice before removing any material feature or functionality of the Developer Services (excluding Previews), unless security, legal, or system performance considerations require an expedited removal.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Preview features.</strong> We may make features available on a Preview basis. Previews are provided “AS-IS” and are excluded from the SLAs and warranties in Section 7 below. Previews may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance, privacy, availability, reliability, and support commitments, as further explained in the Privacy Statement, and any additional notices provided with the Preview. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a Preview into “General Availability”, and if we do make Previews “Generally Available” we may charge for any such features.</li></ol></div><h2>2. Software.</h2><div style="margin-left:20px"><ol type="a"><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Using Microsoft Software outside the Service.</strong> Microsoft may provide you with Microsoft Software through or as a part of the Developer Services. Termination of use of or access to the Developer Services or the termination of this Agreement terminates your right to possess or use any such Microsoft Software; and the suspension or termination of a User Plan terminates that user’s right to possess or use any such Microsoft Software that was acquired through, is attached to, or otherwise requires that User Plan. You must delete all copies of such Microsoft Software licensed under this Agreement and destroy any associated media upon the termination of the associated possession or usage rights. Microsoft may provide you with Microsoft Software for use outside the Developer Services and with (1) the Developer Services or (2) programs you develop using the Developer Services. If the Microsoft Software is provided with its own license terms, those terms control as modified by the foregoing. If the Microsoft Software does not have its own license terms, then you may install and use any number of copies of the Microsoft Software to design, develop, and test your programs on devices. This subsection does not apply to Microsoft Software addressed in subsection (b) below.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Software on Documentation Portals.</strong>Software accessible on the Documentation Portals is made available by the designated publisher under the associated license terms. If Software is accessible on the Documentation Portals without license terms, then subject subsection (c) below you may use it to design, develop, and test your programs. If any such Software without license terms is marked as “sample” or “example,” then you may use it under the terms of the Microsoft Limited Public License.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Scope of rights.</strong> All Microsoft Software are the copyrighted works of Microsoft or its suppliers. All Microsoft Software are licensed not sold and may not be transferred unless specified otherwise in any license terms provided with the Microsoft Software. Rights to access Microsoft Software on any device do not give you any right to implement Microsoft patents or other Microsoft intellectual property in software or devices that access that device.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Third party software.</strong> You are solely responsible for any third party software that you install, connect, or use with any Service. We will not run or make any copies of such third party software outside of our relationship with you. You may only install or use any third party software with any Service in a way that does not subject our intellectual property or technology to any terms governing such software. We are not a party to and are not bound by any terms governing your use of any third party software. We do not grant any licenses or rights, express or implied, to such third party software.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Open source software as part of the Service.</strong> If the Service uses or distributes any third party software with open source software license terms (“Open Source”), then such Open Source is licensed to you by Microsoft solely to allow you to interact with the Service under terms of this Agreement. Copies of those applicable Open Source licenses and any other notices, if any, are included for your information only.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Application programming interfaces.</strong> Microsoft will not assert any of its patent rights on account of your products calling application programming interfaces that it publishes on the Documentation Portals (“APIs”) in order to receive services from the Microsoft product that exposes the APIs.</li></ol></div><h2>3. Microsoft Content.</h2><p>All Microsoft Content is the copyrighted work of Microsoft or its suppliers, and is governed by the terms of the license agreement that accompanies or is included with the Microsoft Content. If the Microsoft Content does not include a license agreement, then you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Microsoft Content for your internal use in designing, developing, and testing your software, products and services that is made available to you on the Documentation Portals without a license agreement. You must preserve the copyright notice in all copies of the Microsoft Content and ensure that both the copyright notice and this permission notice appear in those copies. Accredited educational institutions, such as K-12 schools, universities, and private or public colleges may download and reproduce Microsoft Content for distribution in the classroom for educational purposes.</p><h2>4. Security, privacy, and Customer Data.</h2><div style="margin-left:20px"><ol type="a"><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Security.</strong> We maintain technical and organizational measures, internal controls, and data security routines intended to protect Customer Data against accidental loss or change, unauthorized disclosure or access, or unlawful destruction.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Privacy and data location.</strong> We treat Customer Data in accordance with the terms herein and our Privacy Statement.

You will obtain any necessary consent or rights from end users or others whose data or personal information or other data you will be hosting in the Services.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Rights to Provide Customer Data.</strong> You are solely responsible for your Customer Data. You must have, and you hereby grant us, sufficient rights to use and distribute Customer Data (including Customer Data sourced from third parties) necessary for us to provide you the Developer Services without violating the rights of any third party, or otherwise obligating Microsoft to you or to any third party. We do not assume any additional obligations that may apply to Customer Data except as required by applicable law.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Ownership of Customer Data.</strong> Except for software and Content we license to you, as between the parties, you retain all right, title and interest in and to Customer Data. We acquire no rights in Customer Data other than as described in this Section 4.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Use of Customer Data.</strong> We will use Customer Data to provide the Services. This use may include troubleshooting to prevent, find and fix problems with the operation of the Services and ensuring compliance with this Agreement. It may also include: providing you with suggestions to help you discover and use functionality within the Services; improving the features of our Services; and otherwise use patterns, trends, and other statistical data derived from Customer Data to provide, operate, maintain, and improve our products and services. We will not use Customer Data or derive information from it for any (1) advertising or (2) other commercial purposes (beyond providing you with the Services) without your consent.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Customer Data return and deletion.</strong> You may delete your Customer Data at any time. If you terminate your account we may delete Customer Data immediately without any retention period. We have no additional obligation to continue to hold, export, or return Customer Data and have no liability whatsoever for deletion of Customer Data pursuant to this Agreement. The Developer Services may have features that incur additional charges or are only available at a specific paid-for-service feature tier. If your account is in arrears or is downgraded to a lesser service feature tier your Customer Data will be preserved, but certain features necessary to access that Customer Data may be inaccessible.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Third party requests of Customer Data.</strong> We will not disclose Customer Data to a third party (including law enforcement, other government entity, or civil litigant, but excluding our subcontractors) except as you direct or unless required by law. We will ask any third party demanding access to your Customer Data to contact you directly using your basic contact information. We will promptly notify you and provide a copy of the demand unless legally prohibited. You are responsible for responding to requests by a third party regarding your use of Services.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Subcontractors.</strong> We may hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as customer support. Any such subcontractors will be permitted to obtain Customer Data only to deliver the services we have retained them to provide. We remain responsible for our subcontractors’ compliance with the obligations set forth in this Agreement.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Compliance with law.</strong> We will comply with all laws applicable to our provision of the Services, including applicable security breach notification laws, but not including any laws applicable to you or your industry that are not generally applicable to information technology services providers. You will comply with all laws applicable to your Customer Data, and use of the Services, including any laws applicable to you or your industry.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Certifications and compliance.</strong> The Developer Services shall be subject to any security, privacy, and compliance practices specifically described for the Developer Services at the Developer Services Portal. These obligations do not apply to any other elements of the Services.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Claims of infringement.</strong> We will inform you if we receive notice claiming that your usage of the Service infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights, and in such instances we may provide your basic contact information to the third party. You will promptly respond to such complaints.</li></ol></div><h2>5. Customer accounts, customer conduct, identity services, and feedback.</h2><div style="margin-left:20px"><ol type="a"><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Account creation.</strong> If any of the Services requires you to open an account, you must complete the registration process by providing us with current, complete and accurate information. You may not select an account user name or identifier that impersonates someone else, is or may be illegal, or may be protected by trademark or other proprietary rights, is vulgar or offensive or may cause confusion. We reserve the right to reject and/or reassign these user names and Service identifiers in our sole discretion.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Responsibility for your accounts.</strong> You are responsible for: any and all activities that occur under your account; maintaining the confidentiality of any non-public authentication credentials associated with your use of the Services; and promptly notifying our customer support team about any possible misuse of your accounts or authentication credentials, or any security incident related to the Services.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Your conduct and the availability of third party content and links to third party content. .</strong> For any public, community interaction you undertake on the Services you must follow the Rules of Conduct.

We may use this information to identify you and authorize access to Microsoft Content, Microsoft Software, and other resources across the Services.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Submissions and feedback.</strong> We do not claim ownership of any Submission unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. However, by providing a Submission, you are irrevocably granting Microsoft and its Affiliates the right to make, use, modify, distribute and otherwise commercialize the Submission in any way and for any purpose (including by granting the general public the right to use your Submissions in accordance with this Agreement, which may change over time). For Submissions provided to the Documentation Portals you further grant the right to publish specific identifying information detailed in the Privacy Statement in connection with your Submission. These rights are granted under all applicable intellectual property rights you own or control. No compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your Submissions. Microsoft is under no obligation to post or use any Submission, and Microsoft may remove any Submission at any time. By providing a Submission you warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to your Submission and that your Submission is not subject to any rights of a third party (including any personality or publicity rights of any person).</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Services accessible only to invited customers.</strong> Elements of the Services may be accessible to you on an invitation only basis, for example as part of a program for using pre-release Services and providing feedback to us (e.g., through the Connect portal). Those Services are confidential information of Microsoft. You may not disclose this confidential information to any third party for a period of five years. This restriction does not apply to any information that is or becomes publicly available without a breach of this restriction, was lawfully known to the receiver of the information without an obligation to keep it confidential, is received from another source who can disclose it lawfully and without an obligation to keep it confidential, or is independently developed. You may disclose this confidential information if required to comply with a court order or other government demand that has the force of law. Before doing so, you must seek the highest level of protection available and, when possible, give us enough prior notice to provide a reasonable chance to seek a protective order.</li></ol></div><h2>6. Term, termination, and suspension.</h2><div style="margin-left:20px"><ol type="a"><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Agreement Term and termination.</strong> You may terminate this Agreement at any time. If you have purchased access to Developer Services through Windows Azure then you must pay any amounts due and owing.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Regulatory</strong>. . In any country where any current or future government regulation or requirement that applies to us, but not generally to businesses operating there, presents a hardship to us operating the Services without change, and/or causes us to believe this Agreement or the Services may be in conflict with any such regulation or requirement, we may change the Services or terminate the Agreement. Your sole remedy for such changes to the Services under this Section is to terminate this Agreement.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Suspension.</strong> We may suspend your use of the Services if: (1) reasonably needed to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data; (2) you fail to respond to a claim of alleged infringement under Sections 4.k or 8 within a reasonable time; or (3) you violate this Agreement. We will attempt to suspend access to the minimum necessary part of the Services while the condition or need exists. We will give notice before we suspend, except where we reasonably believe we need to suspend immediately. If you do not fully address the reasons for the suspension within 60 days after we suspend, we may terminate this Agreement and delete your Customer Data without any retention period. We may also terminate your account if your use of the Developer Services is suspended more than twice in any 12-month period.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Termination for non-usage.</strong> We may suspend or terminate a Service account after a prolonged period of inactivity. For Developer Services, if you have a free account we may terminate this Agreement and/or delete any Customer Data automatically generated during the Developer Services sign up process if you fail to upload or create any Customer Data within 90 days of your initial provisioning of the Developer Service. We will provide you with notice prior to any account suspension or termination, or Customer Data deletion.</li><li style="padding-bottom:7px"><strong>Termination of Access to Documentation Portals.</strong> We reserve the right to terminate your access to the Documentation Portals at any time, without notice, for any reason whatsoever.</li></ol></div><h2>7.
