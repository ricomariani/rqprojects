FIXED: ID:11 Tiny IRC should probably support whisper and main channel changing
FIXED: ID:12 Tiny IRC really needs a 'who' list
FIXED: ID:13 the set top map and set bottom map features are really redundant at this point, should probably be deleted

FIXED: when you right click on a skill/spell on the virtual sheet it would be nice to see some help for that item
FIXED: parsed chargen items do not give away the critter name on ready rolls
FIXED: you can change virtual sheets from the token popup menu for party characters

FIXED: sprint checks are not considering the encumberance of the person
FIXED: the number of events allowed is too low
FIXED: the http system should have a way to spit out a calendar automatically
FIXED: use of regular expression in date matching could cause exceptions if there were syntax errors
FIXED: each party should have a current date
FIXED: the event command needs to accept the current party as an argument and use the name and date for events
FIXED: the room names in the party folder cannot be allowed to conflict with the party folder names, all party origin names should get an @ prefix or # prefix

FIXED: sheet import now flexibily detects start of items section, this makes Setsuko's sheet work correctly for instance
FIXED: dossier details should be displayed on the virtual sheet
FIXED: when deleting a bezier segment preserve its first control point the next segment is a bezier too
FIXED: when moving bezier end points, the two nearest control points should move with the node, preserving the local slope
FIXED: when selecting bezier segments you should get handles the control points nearest the node if available
FIXED: There are extra refreshes that kill selection and it's driving me crazy...  Mouseup did not check to see if the item had not moved before saving it!
FIXED: creating a path from a line should be done by extending the line at either end as though it were already a one segment path
FIXED: existing paths should allow end extension even if a node hasn't been selected yet
FIXED: it would be cool if movement from the server was detected and animated instead of insta-moved

FIXED: need an easy way to mass move items an exact number of tiles in case the map items are getting near the edge  (Actions/Bulk Move)

FIXED: added support for wizardry scraping and display
FIXED: added music magic import features
FIXED: spirit block should be giving 50% defense per pt
FIXED: add performance mana for everyone
FIXED: free defence from spirit block was getting full defense not zero plus the block
FIXED: added !mtrn for mysticism training


detect existing files in the image upload dir, warn if you try to overwrite them
dragon shugenja school has a wierd bonus calculation which is not yet done, that means Gris is busted if INT or POW buffed
add some path extension animations so that looks nice, it will be more common
add battle mode so that saves are made more frequently during periods were more archiving would be nice
when copying a bulk selection preserve Z order
make sure specialization is working right in the sorcery wizard
