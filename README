The software in the subdirectories here is intended to be released by me, Rico Mariani,
the author, under the MIT license above.  Some files are not readily marked or end up
easily stripped.  So for clarity I wish to indicate that the XAML files included here
are part of the license as above even though they do not contain the marker.  Likewise
for the project files.

HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO EXCEPTIONS:

The Color Picker and Font Chooser dialogs had their origin in an MSDN sample as indicated there.
See https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wpfsdk/2006/10/26/uncommon-dialogs-font-chooser-color-picker-dialogs/
That code is not covered by my (Rico Mariani's) MIT License Grant.  However as an MSDN sample
it is understood to be covered by the MLPL.

: "If Microsoft makes any code marked as "sample" available on this Web Site without a License Agreement,
then that code is licensed to you under the terms of the Microsoft Limited Public License."

As required, this is the license.

Microsoft Limited Public License (Ms-LPL) 

This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software, you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the software. 

1. Definitions 

The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution" have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law. A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software. A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this license. "Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its contribution. 

2. Grant of Rights 

(A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative works that you create. 
(B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the software. 

3. Conditions and Limitations 

(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks. 
(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically. 
(C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software. 
(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license. 
(E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. 

4. (F) Platform Limitation- The licenses granted in sections 2(A) & 2(B) extend only to the software or derivative works that you create that run on a Microsoft Windows operating system product.

ADDITIONAL EXCEPTION

I have reached out to Nukeation for a grant of license as they are probably not interested in this IP after 10 yeras; 
Lacking such grant the file will have to be replaced.  It cannot be distributed.  If it is accidently in the distrubtion
at any time it should be deleted.
It is not public domain or generally open source under any license.  I purchased a copy for use in this project.

Should the licensing change, this notice will be updated, until that time it must persist.
